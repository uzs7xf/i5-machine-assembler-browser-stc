# i5-machine-assembler-browser-stc
new product idea

An Intel i5 or similar machine without an operating system (OS) is to be taken. A revolutionary assembler based browser called "STC Browser" is to be developed. No intermediate shell like DOS or Linux will be needed. Those can be developed on top of the browser afterwards. The browser window is the only operating system and software on this machine. Interfaces to hardware components and the internet are to be included in this browser window. Especially connections to the LAN, WLAN and Bluetooth interface have already to be developed for the first prototype of this computer system to be able to access all the data available online today. Future software components can be developed also in a higher programming language and/or assembler. Highly qualified hardware and software experts need to be hired by myself.
